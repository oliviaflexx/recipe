This is a web app that you can use to browse recipes based on what ingredients you have at home.
You choose what recipes you want to buy groceries for and Milisti tells you exactly how much of each ingredient you need.
I got all of the data used by webscraping BudgetBytes and then cleaning the ingredients to make them standardized.
The webscraper is in the recipe_data folder and the web app is in the django_recipe folder.
I used python and django for the backend and Heroku for deployment.
